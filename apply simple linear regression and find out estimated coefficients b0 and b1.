Consider following observations/data. And apply simple linear regression and find out estimated coefficients b0 and b1.( use numpy package)
x= [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,11,13]
y = ([1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12,16, 18]


import numpy as np
x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
y = np.array([2, 3, 5, 4, 6])
n = len(x)
mean_x = np.mean(x)
mean_y = np.mean(y)
SS_xy = np.sum(x * y) - n * mean_x * mean_y
SS_xx = np.sum(x * x) - n * mean_x * mean_x
b1 = SS_xy / SS_xx
b0 = mean_y - b1 * mean_x
print("Estimated coefficient b1 (slope):"
,b1)
print("Estimated coefficient b0 (y-intercept):"
,b0)
