Write a program in python to print the number of outliers. Generate 200 samples, from a normal distribution, centered around the value 100, with a standard deviation of 5

import numpy as np
data = np.random.normal(100, 5, 200)
threshold = 2
mean = np.mean(data)
std_dev = np.std(data)
z_scores = (data - mean) / std_dev
outliers = np.where(np.abs(z_scores) >
threshold)[0]
print("Number of outliers:"
, len(outliers))
print("Outlier indices:"
, outliers)
